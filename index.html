						<h2>History</h2>
						
						<p class="lead-in"> A former assassin of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Beatrix just wanted to quietly retire.</p>
						
						<p> She was romantically involved with squad's leader, Bill. While on a mission abroad to kill criminal lord, Lisa Wong, she discovered she was pregnant with Bill's child. Not wanting to expose her child the violent life she was living, she disappeared for 3 months, during which she started a new life in El Paso, started to work in a music shop and became engaged to her boss, Tommy Plumpton.

							Bill thought Kiddo dead, and by searching her killers to punish them, he found Bea alive and in the middle of the wedding rehearsal. The Viper's killed the 9 persons in the church and severely abused Bea before Bill killed her, as she was telling him she was pregnant.</p>
						
						<p>But, she didn't die. After awakening from a 4 years coma, she plotted her revenge against those who had attacked her in El Paso. She ultimatley finished 3 of them and blinded another one before getting to her main target: Bill himself.

							Bill had a surprise for her, though. Their child, B.B., had also survived was now a precious 4 year old girl. After an exchange of intentions, reasons and motivations Bill allowed Beatrix to have her revenge, and she did, killing her former lover with an ancient Chinese technique.
							
							Beatrix and B.B. are now living their best life with their dog, Lucky and regularly attend therapy.
